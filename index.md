## answers
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I think the most interesting topic is polygenic risk score (PRS). This is my first time heard about this and I think it is very direct yet also comprehensive measure of someone's genetic risk for a certain disease. I am interested in learning more about it's potential in clinics. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I am very interested in neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's). One potential topic for Quarter 2 project would be building a PRS model that quantifies an indiviudal's genetic risk for Alzheimer's. Specifically, I want to analyze the relation between genetic variations and the expression of traits associated with Alzheimer's, such as tau protein aggregation and cognitive decline.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
For quarter 1, I have mostly been familiarizing with domain knowledges and the tools in anlayzing genome data. Therefore, my Quarter 1 proejct is a bit limited to the tasks and techniques mentioned in our meetings. If I have more time, I would like to try other anlaysis to enrich my project.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I want to incorporate some other common analysis in genetics like UMAP, volcano plots, and pathway enrichment analysis if possible.
